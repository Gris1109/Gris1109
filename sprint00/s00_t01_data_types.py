    # Data types are the classification or categorization of data items.
    # It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data,
    # since everything is an object in Python programming.

## Create a script that prints values in different data types:

    # • integer with a value: 50
    # • ﬂoat with a value: -42.00001
    # • string with a value: 'Gris Money'
    # • boolean with a value: True

integer_value = 50
float_value = -42.00001
string_value = 'Gris Money'
boolean_value = False


print (integer_value)
print (float_value)
print (string_value)
print (boolean_value)
