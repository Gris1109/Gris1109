## Create a script that (the ﬁrst two requirements were done for you):
# • asks to enter two numbers in sequence
# • stores values in variables a  and b  respectively, and casts them to type integer 
# • performs primitive math operations on them and stores the result of each operation in variable c

   # – addition (+)
   # – subtraction (-)
   # – multiplication (*)
   # – division (/)
   # – modulus (%)
   # – exponent (**)
   # – ﬂoor division (//)

# • prints the result for each operation 


a = int(input('Enter the ﬁrst number: '))
b = int(input('Enter the second number: '))

c = a + b
print (c)

c = a - b
print (c)

c = a * b
print (c)

c = a / b
print (c)

c = a % b
print (c)

c = a ** b
print (c)

c = a // b
print (c)
