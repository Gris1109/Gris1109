## Create a script that:

# • performs math operations with variables:
   # a = 3
   # b = 10
   # c = -14.8
   # d = True

# • casts the variables or their math operations results into different data types (use the code snippet in the SYNOPSIS,
# but instead of ... put the correct keywords to get the needed result)

# • prints operations


a = 3
b = 10
c = -14.8
d = True



# SYNOPSIS:
 # result = ﬂoat(a + b)
 # result = ...(c - b)
 # result = ...(c) + ...(b)
 # result = ...(a - a)


print (ﬂoat(a + b))
print (int(c - b))
print (float(c) + bool(b))
print (bool(a - a))
