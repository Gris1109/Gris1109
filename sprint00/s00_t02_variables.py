## What is a variable in programming?

    # A variable in simple terms is a storage place that has some memory allocated to it. Basically, a variable is used to store some form of data.
    # Different types of variables require different amounts of memory,
    # different type of memory locations, and some specific set of operations that can be applied to them.


##  What characters can you use in a variable name?

    #A variable name can consist of alphabets (both upper and lower case), numbers, and the underscore ‘_’ character. However, the name must not start with a number.


##  How to deﬁne a variable?

    # *variable name = data type


## Create a script that: • deﬁnes the following variables:

    # – an integer called my_int with the value 117
    # – a ﬂoat called my_ﬂoat with the value 24.123
    # – a string called my_str with the value 'This is gris'
    # – a boolean called my_bool with the value True

# prints the variable and types of each of these variables using the function type() in the correct order

my_int = 117
my_float = 24.123
my_str = 'This is gris'
my_bool = True

print (my_int,  type(my_int))
print (my_float,  type(my_float))
print (my_str,  type(my_str))
print (my_bool,  type(my_bool))
